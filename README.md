# Pic Bay

"Pic Bay" is ReactJS app, which uses pixbay API, and allows user to search for specific images, showing statistics: views, likes, downloads. Tailwind CSS helped me to make this app responsive really easy. Deployed with AWS, you can try it here:

## Run

```
npm i           #to download all dependencies
npm start       #the server will open page automatically
```
